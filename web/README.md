This directory contains files for GitHub Pages, which are used to create and deploy our website. You can view the live site at: [CatInBeard.github.io/pb-apps](https://CatInBeard.github.io/pb-apps)
## Local Build
To build a local copy of the site, you can use the make command. Please note that you will need to have Docker installed on your machine to use this command. This will allow you to preview the site on your local machine.
## Translations
If you find an error in the translation, you can correct it in the [src directory](./src), where language files are stored. For example, to fix an error in the English translation, you can edit the [en.json](./src/en.json) file. After making changes, you can create a pull request so we can include your correction in our project.

Thank you for helping us improve our project!
